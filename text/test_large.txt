 Hello, testing 123. Why tunnels? To solve the problem of soul-destroying traffic, roads must go 3D, which means either flying cars or tunnels are needed. Like flying cars, tunnels are weatherproof, are out of sight and won't fall on your head. Tunnels minimize usage of valuable surface land and do not conflict with existing transportation systems. A large network of tunnels can alleviate congestion in any city. No matter how large a city grows, more levels of tunnels can be added.
