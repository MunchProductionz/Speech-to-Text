 Hello, testing 123. Why tunnels? To solve the problem of soul-destroying traffic, roads must go with 3D, which means either flying cars or tunnels are needed. Unlike flying cars, tunnels are weatherproof, out of land and won't fall on your head. Tunnels minimize the usage of valuable surface land and enough conflict with existing transportation systems. A large network of tunnels can alleviate congestion in any city. No matter how large a city grows, more levels of tunnels can be added.
